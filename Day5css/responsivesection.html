    <p><b>Fluid Layouts:</b> Instead of fixed widths, use percentage or em units for elements widths and margins to allow them to resize proportionally with the screen.</p>
    <p><b>Benefits:</b> Ensures that the layout adapots smoothly to different screen sizes, maintaing readability and structure.</p>
<br>
<h3>Media Queries</h3>
<p>Media queries allow you to apply different CSS styles based on the screen size or device characteristics.</p>
<p>You can use media queries to change the layout of a feature section from a two-column layout on larger screens to a single-column layout on smaller screens.</p>
<br>
<h3>Flexible Media</h3>
<p>Images: Use max-width: 100% and height: auto for images to ensure they don't overflow their containers and maintain their aspect ratio.</p>
<p><b>Benefits:</b> Ensures that all content scales appropriately and remains readable on different devices.</p>
